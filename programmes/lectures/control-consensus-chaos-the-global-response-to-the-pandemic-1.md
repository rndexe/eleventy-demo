description: >
  Though COVID-19 has affected numerous countries across the globe, some nations
  have managed to contain the virus while others are still struggling to do so.
  The wide-ranging responses—as well as impacts—of this pandemic have spurred
  research that spans multiple countries in order to gain deeper insights into
  the causes of variance and the future of pandemic preparedness.


  In this talk, Professor Sheila Jasanoff will present a study that compared pandemic responses in eighteen countries. Research teams in each country have closely followed the crisis in three interlocking sectors—health, economy, politics—providing vital information on how and why Covid-19 has produced such different outcomes and what policy-makers can do moving forward. Jasanoff, who co-directed the study, will talk about the most surprising findings from this massive undertaking and discuss how they can inform our understanding of the human impacts of the pandemic.
