  The lecture examines the way in which a new photographic genre emerged in the
  context of the third plague pandemic (1894-1959): epidemic photography.
  Differing from medical photography in that it did not focus on symptoms or the
  pathology of the disease, epidemic photography took as its subject the real or
  imagined causes of plague outbreaks across the globe, as well as the methods
  to combat the spread and maintenance of the disease in and between different
  urban and rural environments. 


  The lecture will argue that at the same time as providing a visual framing of epidemics and the struggle against them that continues to inform our experience and response to infectious diseases today, epidemic photography played a key role in establishing the notion and experience of the “pandemic” in the modern world.
