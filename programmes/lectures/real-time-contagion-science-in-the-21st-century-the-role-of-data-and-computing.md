description: >-
  Infectious diseases cause more than 10 million deaths a year worldwide.
  Despite significant advances by scientists and public health authorities that
  have led to reduced rates of infections and mortality, we continue to find
  ourselves unable to respond rapidly and effectively to pandemics. The ongoing
  spread of COVID-19 serves as a grim reminder of our collective inability to
  control pandemics. Pandemics will recur again: the question is not if, but
  when. Globalization, anti-microbial resistance, anthropomorphic changes such
  as population growth, globally networked economies and urbanization, climate
  change, new technologies such as synthetic biology that might be used to
  design pathogens, and ecological pressures threaten to upend the progress we
  have made in fighting infectious diseases. 


  In this lecture, Professor Madhav Marathe will argue that pandemics are a complex systems problem and are intricately tied to the social, behavioral, medical, political and economic issues that go beyond human health and national boundaries. Since Bernoulliâ€™s work in 1760 on smallpox inoculation, mathematical and computational models have played an important role in the study of epidemics. He will discuss how and if recent advances in computing, data and biological sciences can be harnessed to develop new techniques and engineering principles that can further advance the field and, in the end, help reduce the global burden of infectious diseases.  He will also highlight the challenges one faces in developing tools during an evolving pandemic. 


  Pandemics are just one kind of contagion in a long list of contagions, including power blackouts, global financial contagions, contagions caused by computer malware, collective behavior by bacterial colonies using quorum sensing, and the information and mis(dis)-information campaigns on the social media. Marathe will discuss how unifying mathematical principles and engineering principles can be developed to understand and respond to such networked contagion-like phenomena. He will conclude the lecture by discussing how societies can cope with these global contagions by balancing the short term objectives such as economic growth and social well-being with long term objectives of resilience and sustainability.

expertbio: Madhav Marathe is a Distinguished Professor in Biocomplexity, the
  division director of the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing
  Division at the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative, and a Professor in the
  Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA).   He is a
  passionate advocate and practitioner of transdisciplinary team
  science.  During his 25-year professional career, he has established and led a
  number of large transdisciplinary projects and groups. His research interests
  are in network and data science, computational epidemiology, AI, foundations
  of computing  and high performance computing. Throughout his career, he has
  been studying contagion like phenomenon that occur in social and engineered
  systems. This includes, (non)-infectious diseases, computer viruses, and
  cascades in social and infrastructure systems. For instance, the division he
  leads has supported federal and state authorities in their effort to combat
  epidemics in real-time, including the  H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the Ebola
  outbreak in 2014 and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.
