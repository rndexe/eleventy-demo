  The COVID-19 pandemic has sent alarm bells ringing throughout the world. This
  pandemic has led the world to confront the glaring difficulties in the realm
  of public health and medicine. While we have witnessed great socio-political
  and economic turbulence since the start of this pandemic, we’ve also seen a
  renewal of trust in science and experts. The public has increasingly been
  turning to experts in these times of crisis, and there is an acknowledgement
  of the necessity for scholars and experts in dealing with the pandemic. 


  Sir Jeremy Farrar will talk about the lessons we have learnt  from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the ways in which the role of medicine and healthcare are conceptualized anew in society.
