title: "The Shape of A Laugh | Workshop "
date: 2021-05-29T08:30:00.000Z
description: Based on the artist’s exhibit ‘When the World Was A Laugh’, this
  workshop is an invitation to delve into a collection of laughs from across the
  world, and it will explore the making and the unfolding of a speculative
  fiction out of this collection. In a back and forth interplay between
  performative readings and the experimental modeling of a typology of laughs,
  you will collectively reflect on the role of laughter in the social fabric of
  human relations and beyond.
condition: "This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "

expertbio: >-
  Merging natural sciences and anthropology, myth-making, and new media, visual
  artist Anaïs Tondeur’s practice is anchored in ecology thought. Creating
  installations, photographs, or videos, she seeks a new aesthetic, in the sense
  of a renewal of our modes of perception, to find other conditions of being in
  the world. 

  She has been an artist-in-residence in several art centers and scientific laboratories, which include LeCentQuatre-Grand Paris Express (2018-19), Artlink (Ireland, 2019), the Museum of Arts et Métiers (Paris, 2018-17), and the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES, Paris, 2016).


  She has presented and exhibited her work in international institutions such as the Center Pompidou (Paris), La Gaîté Lyrique (Paris), Serpentines Galleries (London), Bozar (Brussels), and Biennale Di Venezia, (Lieux Infinis).
