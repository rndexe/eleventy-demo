title: "Visualising the Virus: Design As A Medium for Collective Critical Care |
  Workshop "
date: 2021-06-05T04:30:00.000Z
description: >-
  The international digital project, Visualizing the Virus, is an interactive
  platform that showcases and investigates the diverse ways in which the
  coronavirus is visualized, imagined, and the inequalities it makes visible. It
  is led by Dr Sria Chatterjee and supported by DARIAH EU, FHNW, Basel and the
  Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University. Defining visualization
  in the broadest sense, the project explores representations of the virus and
  especially the disparities, histories, and futures its existence shows us.


  This workshop will be held as a follow-up of a course held at National Institute of Design, Visualizing the Invisible: Art, Design and Public Health taught by Dr Sria Chatterjee and Gabriela Aquije Zegarra. With an interdisciplinary group of young designers from the NID, we will convene for two hours for collective dialogue and experiments on how design relates to the social, political and ecological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 


  The workshop will involve a hands-on collective exchange using the Miro board tool and zoom breakout rooms, around four topics that make the virus visible through objects, relations and systems. The workshop aims for an open and discursive outcome in which the participants explore notions of critical and speculative design to trigger curiosity, care and where possible, action around ideas of contagion. 
condition: "This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "
