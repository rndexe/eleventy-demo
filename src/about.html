                            CONTAGION shares a multiplicity of voices and perspectives – contemporary and historic, artistic and scientific, individual and collective – to support better understanding of what we are all living through. <br><br> Covid-19 has been with us for more than a year. The pandemic has upended our lives and illuminated longstanding challenges. In these unsettled times – much more so for some than for others – trustworthy evidence about what is happening changes
                            rapidly. What we have retrieved from this, our very own moment, and in history, are works backed by research that put into relief the reciprocity, empathy, care and knowledge that can develop across disciplines and across experiences at different
                            scales.
                            <br><br> CONTAGION examines the transmission of emotions, behaviours, ideas and diseases, their fascinating and sometimes frightening spread and why all of this matters to the lives we hope to lead and the futures we can imagine. <br><br> Despite
                            uncertainties, throughout the planning and making of this exhibition our goal has remained constant: to create an inspiring and informative public platform that encourages the asking of better and more relevant questions.<br><br> We encourage
                            you to sign up to see the exhibition with our mediators and hope that you will find at least one thing to carry away with you in your hearts and your minds.

                                    Mukund Thattai obtained a B.A. in Physics from Cornell University in 1999, and a Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004. Mukund's interests straddle many disciplines. Immediately following his Ph.D., Mukund took up an
                                    independent position as a Young Investigator at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore; in 2007 he joined the NCBS faculty. Mukund's laboratory at NCBS uses both experimental and computational techniques to study
                                    how cells work. He has made key contributions in the area of synthetic biology, a field which attempts to combine genes into biological circuits. Mukund is deeply involved in public engagement efforts and art/science collaborations,
                                    working with conceptual artists and theatre practitioners to explore the practice of biology and its impact on society.

                                    of its kind worldwide. Evidence-based science is at the core of its work, enabling it to identify health risks reliably and issue recommendations to improve the health of the population. During the founding years from 1891 to 1904,
                                    the institute was headed by Robert Koch, a physician and scientist who, as a result of his research into anthrax, first determined the connection between infectious agent and disease. He later discovered the tuberculosis pathogen for
                                    which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1905. <br><br>The Museum at the RKI, which was established following the death of Robert Koch in 1910 has now developed into a Public Health Visiting Centre since its renovation in 2017.
                                    Acting as a window to science at the Robert Koch Institute, the museum communicates about current topics relevant to public health today, the shift in the last 100 years with respect to infection prevention and research methods, as
                                    well as the history of the institute. Exhibits include some of Robert Koch's possessions, as well as modern visual and media installations.
