        <p class="" >CONTAGION shares a multiplicity of voices and perspectives – contemporary and historic, artistic and scientific, individual and collective – to support better understanding of what we are all living through. <br><br>
            Covid-19 has been with us for more than a year. The pandemic has upended our lives and illuminated longstanding challenges. In these unsettled times – much more so for some than for others –  trustworthy evidence about what is happening changes rapidly. What we have retrieved from this, our very own moment, and in history, are works backed by research that put into relief the reciprocity, empathy, care and knowledge that can develop across disciplines and across experiences at different scales.<br><br>
            
            CONTAGION examines the transmission of emotions, behaviours, ideas and diseases, their fascinating and sometimes frightening spread and why all of this matters to the lives we hope to lead and the futures we can imagine. <br><br>
            
            Despite uncertainties, throughout the planning and making of this exhibition our goal has remained constant: to create an inspiring and informative public platform that encourages the asking of better and more relevant questions.<br><br>
            
            We encourage you to sign up to see the exhibition with our mediators and hope that you will find at least one thing to carry away with you in your hearts and your minds.

Evidence-based science is at the core of its work, enabling it to identify health risks reliably and issue recommendations to improve the health of the population. During the founding years from 1891 to 1904, the institute was headed by Robert Koch, a physician and scientist who, as a result of his research into anthrax, first determined the connection between infectious agent and disease. He later discovered the tuberculosis pathogen for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1905. <br><br>The Museum at the RKI, which was established following the death of Robert Koch in 1910 has now developed into a Public Health Visiting Centre since its renovation in 2017. Acting as a window to science at the Robert Koch Institute, the museum communicates about current topics relevant to public health today, the shift in the last 100 years with respect to infection prevention and research methods, as well as the history of the institute. Exhibits include some of Robert Koch's possessions, as well as modern visual and media installations.
