title: K_Trust and Fear in a Pandemic
desc: Heidi Larson has spent the past two decades trying to understand what
  makes people in various countries hesitant to take vaccines. In response, she
  created the Vaccine Confidence Project, an interdisciplinary project that
  brings together experts and citizens across countries and social networks to
  study how rumours are disseminated and to better understand medical
  misinformation. She argues that in 2021, as governments around the world roll
  out vaccination programmes, we need to rebuild communities’ faith and trust in
  medical information.
