title: G_Community and Care in a Pandemic
desc: Epidemiology is a branch of medical science that studies the distribution
  of diseases in human populations and the factors that determine this
  distribution, chiefly by the use of statistics. With the onset of the COVID-19
  pandemic, this discipline has seen a steady resurgence in public consciousness
  as researchers and policymakers attempt to study the what, when, why, and
  where of the disease and promote good health for all. Jimmy Whitwhorth, an
  epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, shares
  insights he has gleaned from decades of research about how we as
  community-members can anticipate, control, and prevent the spreading of
  disease.
