title: Learning from a Pandemic
desc: Though COVID-19 is primarily a global health crisis, its ripple effect has
  been felt in various spheres of life. It has changed how we work, how we
  relax, and how we connect with each other. However, the effect of the pandemic
  has varied significantly on a global level, with countries responding in
  vastly different ways. Johanna Hanefeld, a social scientist at the Robert Koch
  Institute, has been working on international pandemic preparedness and
  responses. She explores how lessons learned from the current pandemic can help
  us envision a more equitable response to future crises.
