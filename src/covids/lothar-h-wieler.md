title: B_Science and Common Sense in a Pandemic
desc: After many long nights, government bodies in countries across the world
  have announced the roll-out of vaccines that can prevent the spread of
  coronavirus. Lothar H. Wieler, President of the Robert Koch Institute, speaks
  about the speed with which these vaccines have been developed and the science
  behind them. However, as the leader of a public health organisation in
  Germany, he believes that no single intervention can be successful in
  preventing disease. Stressing on the importance of combining science with
  common sense, he explains why personal as well as collective responsibility is
  important in the battle against COVID-19.

  zoonotic diseases in a One health concept, i.e. infections that are passed
  between animals and humans, and account for many of the newly (re-)emerging
  infectious diseases. A particular research interest of Prof. Wieler are the
  molecular mechanisms, which enable bacterial zoonotic pathogens such as *e.
  coli* and *s. aureus* to infect different hosts, and develop resistance to
  antibiotics.
