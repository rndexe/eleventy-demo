title: "The Language of Pandemics "
desc: From “immunogenicity” to “RT-PCR”, COVID-19 has made many once-obscure
  words a part of our everyday conversation. As government bodies, scientists,
  and medical professionals race to combat the virus, more such terms have been
  added to our vocabularies to describe new ways of thinking. The language that
  we use to define the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is a cruel enemy that
  must be defeated through our war rooms and the efforts of our frontline
  workers. But, are we at war with COVID-19? How does our language and cultural
  discourse influence the way we think about the scientific discourse around
  pathogens? Mariam Ghani, an artist, writer, and filmmaker, who has been
  observing the language and metaphors of illness in her latest project,
  Dis-Ease, contemplates these questions.
