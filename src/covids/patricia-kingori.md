title: Fakes and Facts in a Pandemic
desc: Fake news was a very serious issue even before the pandemic broke out.
  But, in the face of COVID-19, this phenomenon has become even more dangerous.
  Whether it's about the origins of the disease, how it spreads, or how it can
  be cured, it has become really difficult to determine what is real and what is
  fake. Patricia Kingori is a sociologist who is deeply committed to
  understanding the role that authenticity plays across different institutions
  and actors. She reflects on what we can learn from paying attention to fakes,
  false information, and forgery during a pandemic.

  Her current research interests intersect the Sociology of Science and
  Medicine, and a critical examination of ethics in practice.

It will also investigate the moral paradoxes associated with such uncertainty.
