title: Lessons from History in a Pandemic
desc: Every known civilisation has battled epidemics of diseases like the
  bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid, and smallpox. Societies’ responses to
  epidemics have shaped our history and continue to influence how we think of
  pandemics in the present day. Connections between past epidemics and
  contemporary society intrigue psychiatrists like Sanjeev Jain, who has worked
  extensively on the history of medicine and mental health in South Asia.
