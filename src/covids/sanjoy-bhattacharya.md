title: D_Lessons from the Past in a Pandemic
desc: Outbreaks and epidemics have affected humanity throughout its existence,
  often changing the course of history. There are many differences between how
  we used to and how we currently respond to epidemics, but there are also many
  points of practice from the past that remain relevant today. Sanjoy
  Bhattacharya, a historian of medicine and health, is both fascinated and
  devastated by his experience of living through the worst pandemic in the past
  100 years. He reflects on how insights from history can help inform
  contemporary health policy.
