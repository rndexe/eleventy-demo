title: Viruses, Variants and Vaccines
desc: "Viruses are fascinating things: they aren’t exactly alive by most
  definitions, but they aren’t inanimate either. They are also deadly, as we can
  see in the current COVID-19 pandemic. But, pandemics aren’t just caused by
  viruses. They are the result of a complex interaction between various factors
  ranging from human-animal interactions to our lived and built environments.
  Shahid Jameel is one of India’s mostly highly regarded virologists. He shares
  his thoughts on why it's important to look beyond SARS-CoV-2 as the singular
  cause of the pandemic."
