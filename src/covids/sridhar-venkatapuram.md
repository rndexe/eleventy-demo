title: C_Health and Justice in a Pandemic
desc: Sridhar Venkatapuram brings health-related natural and social sciences
  together with philosophy in order to understand and address health
  inequalities and injustices. Recently, he has been thinking about the systems
  which allowed the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread at an unprecedented rate. This
  line of enquiry challenges us to think beyond the virus as the only cause of
  the pandemic, and encourages us to reexamine the socioeconomic systems which
  play a critical role in both spreading and controlling disease.

  Sridhar Venkatapuram is an academic researcher, educator, and practitioner in
  global health and philosophy. His work brings health-related natural and
  social sciences together with philosophy in order to understand and address
  health inequalities and injustice. He recently spent one year at the Global
  Health Ethics Unit of the World Health Organization in Geneva.


  Dr Venkatapuramâ€™s most well known work relates to applying the Capabilities Approach to health and health inequalities, particularly the argument for the moral and human right to the capability to be healthy. Health capability, seen as a basic freedom, like other freedoms are socially created and distributed.
