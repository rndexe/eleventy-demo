title: C_Health and Justice in a Pandemic
desc: Sridhar Venkatapuram brings health-related natural and social sciences
  together with philosophy in order to understand and address health
  inequalities and injustices. Recently, he has been thinking about the systems
  which allowed the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread at an unprecedented rate. This
  line of enquiry challenges us to think beyond the virus as the only cause of
  the pandemic, and encourages us to reexamine the socioeconomic systems which
  play a critical role in both spreading and controlling disease.
