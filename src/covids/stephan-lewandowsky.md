title: F_Conspiracies and Trust in a Pandemic
desc: The pandemic has revealed weaknesses in our society, but it has also
  opened avenues for radical change; for conversations about how science can
  save humanity, how populism functions in a democracy, and how we should govern
  social media to prevent the rapid spread of misinformation. Stephan
  Lewandowsky is a cognitive scientist who studies how people think and make
  decisions. He investigates how trust and emotions are manipulated in a global
  health crisis.

speakerfield: Cognitive Scientist
speakerbio: Stephan Lewandowsky is a cognitive scientist with an interest in how
  people update their memories if information they believe turns out to be
  false. This has led him to examine the persistence of misinformation and
  spread of fake news in society, including conspiracy theories. He is
  particularly interested in the variables that determine whether or not people
  accept scientific evidence, for example evidence surrounding vaccinations or
  climate science. Because his research speaks to important contemporary events,
  he contributes to public debate through opinion pieces in the media and public
  engagement.
