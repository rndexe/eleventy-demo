title: A_Managing the Pandemic in India
desc: With more than 10 million cases, India has the second-highest infection
  load in the world after the United States. However, with cutting-edge
  research, invention of new biomedical devices, and a very ambitious
  vaccination program, it could soon become a global leader in the fight against
  COVID-19. Vinod. K. Paul, a member of the National Institution for
  Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, and Head of the National Task Force Against
  COVID-19, shares key questions arising from the journey so far and considers a
  future where India emerges as a hub for innovative biomedical research.
