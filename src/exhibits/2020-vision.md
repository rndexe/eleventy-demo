description: >-
  How can we make sense of the digital world as information multiplies
  exponentially? Online content is proliferating at an astonishing rate, at a
  pace that is much faster than we can possibly hope to match. We are constantly
  bombarded with headlines, clickbait titles, and fake news. 


  In 2020 Vision, the artist attempts to externalise some of this information using animations of various headlines, which reflect back a sense of anxiety as we are bombarded with questions, some trivial and some vitally important. These animations grow on the screen like a virus in a Petri dish before gradually receding again.

  array of Google News headlines. 2019. Text animation, 2'07\". "
