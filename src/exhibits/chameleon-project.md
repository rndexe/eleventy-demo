description: >
  In daily encounters, people automatically and continuously synchronize with
  the facial expressions, voices, postures, movements of others. Some of these
  encounters happen in milli-seconds. Through unconscious mimicry, we forge a
  bond with each other through our gestures and movements—long before we utter a
  word. In essence, we are carriers, dancing with each other in harmonized body
  language, infecting each other with our emotions. The Chameleon Project
  translates the experience of catching emotions from people into a
  technology-driven video installation. 

  We stand in front of a screen and the screen starts talking to us. Not with words but by showing us videos and images of people in emotional states that are in tandem with ours. Artist Tina Gonsalves, social neuroscientist Chris Frith, emotion neuroscientist Hugo Critchley, affective computer scientists Rosalind Picard and Rana El Kaliouby, as well as Professor in affective computing, Nadia Berthouz, came together to create a system that could read a person’s emotions, and then decide a congruent emotion to reflect back. Drawing on theories of emotional contagion, The Chameleon Project is placed at the intersection of multiple research areas such as empathy, social networks, affecting computing.

authorbio: >
  Tina Gonsalves is an artist whose practice integrates science, art, and
  technology to create embodied, interactive audiovisual experiences. Tina has
  been exploring ideas about the emotional body since 1994, first making short
  films that aimed to translate internal emotional states into an external
  medium. Finding the basic film format increasingly inadequate, she moved on to
  installations to look at ways technology could access the emotional signatures
  of the body. 

  Tina has been an Artist-in-Residence in the Department of Neuroimaging at UCL, at the Banff New Media Institute in Canada, the Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague, and many more. Some of the grants she has received include the Arts Queensland Major Grant, the Arts Council England Grant, and the Wellcome Trust Large Art Award.
