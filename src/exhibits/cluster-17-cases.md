title: A Cluster of 17 Cases
subtitle: The corridor of uncertainty
medium: Interactive website
year: "2018"
description: >
  On the night of 21 February 2003, a 64-year-old doctor from Guangdong, China
  checked into Room 911 of Hong Kong’s Metropole Hotel to attend a family
  wedding. That night he infected 16 people on the same floor of the hotel. As
  they checked out, the guests took Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
  across the world.  


  In this interactive artwork, we virtually enter the Metropole Hotel on that fateful night, and we explore the events that took place in the 17 rooms where the first cluster of SARS cases were detected. We go on a  journey with epidemiologists to understand how they studied the movements of the guests between each room. This experience reveals how even the most banal action, like touching a handrail, can have unforeseen consequences. In the end, we come away with a renewed appreciation for how public health experts grapple with fear and uncertainty in the face of an unknown disease.
