  The science and public health engineering behind controlling past epidemics
  has profoundly shaped our response to current pandemics like COVID-19. Much of
  the early work around identifying and responding to infectious diseases was
  done by Robert Koch, a German physician and bacteriologist, who discovered the
  cycle of the anthrax disease as well as the causative agents of tuberculosis
  and cholera. 

  This exhibit contains photographs and simulations courtesy of the Museum at the Robert Koch Institute. It takes us through the various places around the world where Robert Koch made his pioneering discoveries, and provokes us to reflect on how our responses to infectious diseases continue to evolve through time.

  **Wolsztyn**. Almost 14000 people live in this little town in modern day
  Poland. A beautiful baroque church catches the eye when one walks down the
  street, where Robert Koch once lived. It isn’t entirely clear why he was drawn
  to this town hidden away in the Province of Posen, part of the Prussian empire
  between 1848 and 1919. Perhaps it was his chance to get closer to nature, his
  childhood fascination. 

  An epidemic that leaves many animals dead gets him involved as district physician. It was here that Koch, in 1876, provides first evidence of a link between a bacterium and an infectious disease: Anthrax.

  **Berlin**. A city brimming with ideas, and a rich yet devastating history – it is now the second

  most populous city in Europe, with almost 3.8 million inhabitants. People from all walks of

  life, live and work here. The once distinctive sound of trotting on cobblestone streets has

  now been replaced with modern day engines. Despite several stately buildings being

  destroyed during the II World War, many still dominate the skyline, including the structures

  of the historic Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases. It was established as a

  research institute for Robert Koch owing to his enormous efforts and success in the

  identification of the causative agent of a disease, which in 1882 killed one in seven people:

  Tuberculosis.

  **Kolkata**. Also known as the city of joy, it is the third most densely inhabited metropolitan

  city in India, with a suburban population of over 14 million. Under the British Raj, Kolkata

  becomes the capital of British-held territories in India for over a century, with the Port of

  Kolkata being the oldest operating port in India. A walk through the city at noon leaves you

  seeking refuge in one of its beautiful old structures, like the Victoria Memorial, which stands

  proudly amidst luscious gardens. In 1883, an epidemic which spreads like fire, plagues

  Kolkata’s inhabitants and prompts Robert Koch to travel from Egypt to India to investigate:

  Cholera

  The threats that were once formidable continue to remain threats, each in their own

  measure. We now live in a global world. Increased urbanization has led to megacities, and

  international mobility is on a scale never seen before. A journey that took Robert Koch a  few weeks to complete now takes us a few hours. Even back in 1883, Robert Koch sketched out the most probable sea routes by which cholera, then thought of as a disease of the poor, was likely to find its way to the heart of Europe. Today scientists at the Robert Koch-Institute simulate the

  potential routes of deadly viruses via air traffic worldwide.


  *(Simulation (Dirk Brockmann) World air traffic, potential routes of deadly viruses)*


  Robert Koch’s work changed the way we look at contagion and in the last century we have

  found ways to fight infectious diseases. But what if diseases like anthrax, tuberculosis and

  cholera are not the biggest threats to our existence anymore?


  In late 2019 the world was hit by the largest pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918.

  COVID-19 has resulted in more than a 100 million cases and cost over 2.5 million lives

  worldwide. Evidence-based science and vaccination remain the most effective ways of preventing and treating infection. So how worried should we really be, when we start to see the cracks in these concrete structures now holding the world of infectious medicine together? What should we do when we find that the rate at which these cracks get bigger surpasses our

  ability to fix them? Today, many have lost faith in science, and evidence-based knowledge

  Robert Koch was the first to provide bacteriological proof that locally-occurring cholera outbreaks were caused by poor water quality.


  In 1883, Robert Koch sketched out the most probable sea routes by which cholera was

  likely to be transmitted to Europe. It appears less likely to be accepted than fake news and rumours which often feed on our inner fears and emotions. Have we gone against our most powerful allies in the battle against infectious disease and is this contagion of disbelief spreading faster than a deadly virus?

  The Robert Koch Institute, as a National Public Health Institute, faces many new challenges but remains a pillar of knowledge, evidence-based research,  communication and surveillance of public health. We connect with international  players in a quest to find solutions for global health problems.
