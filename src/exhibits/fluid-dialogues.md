subtitle: The burden of stigma
medium: Film
year: "2021"
description: >-
  Contagious diseases have shaped human history and they continue to remain with
  us today. The danger that they pose towards our health goes hand in hand with
  the social danger of stigmatization - people are shunned, feared and
  discriminated against according to their medical status. 


  Fluid Dialogues juxtaposes interviews of people living with HIV along with microscopic footage of their blood to create an intimate moment of reflection on the social implications of living with a contagious disease. Through this work, the artist provokes us to reflect on how social ties, and relationships can be damaged through our impulse to blame, and irrational fears of contamination.

    authorbio: Andrés García Vidal (Sevilla, 1991) works as an artist and recordist
      within the sound studies frame with a focus on aural and oral culture.
      From an interest in audio’s intrusive scope and its capacity to “break
      into” he explores specific contexts through the notion of noise, speech
      and participative processes.
