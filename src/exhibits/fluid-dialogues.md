subtitle: The burden of stigma
medium: Film
year: "2021"
description: >-
  Contagious diseases have shaped human history and they continue to remain with
  us today. The danger that they pose towards our health goes hand in hand with
  the social danger of stigmatization - people are shunned, feared and
  discriminated against according to their medical status. 


  Fluid Dialogues juxtaposes interviews of people living with HIV along with microscopic footage of their blood to create an intimate moment of reflection on the social implications of living with a contagious disease. Through this work, the artist provokes us to reflect on how social ties, and relationships can be damaged through our impulse to blame, and irrational fears of contamination.

authorname: Basse Stittgen
authorbio: The work of Basse Stittgen is positioned at the intersection of
  design, art and material research. It stems from a fascination for matter, how
  it can be created, applied, used, reused and questioned. This approach might
  lead to investigations into production cycles, or become a tool to unfold
  hidden narratives and potentials embedded in matter.
