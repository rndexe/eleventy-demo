title: "COVID-19 Indoor Safety Guidelines"
subtitle: The inner life of a virus
medium: Interactive
year: "2020"
description: >-
  Indoor safety is crucial to curtailing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. How
  can we protect ourselves in a closed environment? How do we ensure safety in
  our homes, schools, and other indoor public spaces? The online tool created by
  John W. Bush, Martin Bazant, and Kasim Khan captures the realities of the
  infectious potential of COVID-19 in indoor spaces. The COVID-19 Indoor Safety
  Guidelines tool allows a user to tinker with the controls: you can choose the
  room specifications, the number of people, the kind of activity. Once the
  information is plugged in, the system tells you how many hours it would take
  for people to get infected, provided there is one positive case of COVID-19 in
  the room.


  This tool brings data, computing, and research into a user-friendly and comprehensible format, keeping us better informed about the risk of infection in these uncertain times.
