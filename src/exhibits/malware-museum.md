  After the advent of computer systems and related technology, human diseases
  ceased to be the only contagious and deadly infections plaguing us. Computer
  viruses have cost us labour hours, money, and privacy. The earliest ones began
  to crop up in the 1970s; the “Creeper Worm” is largely accepted as the first
  self-replicating program that spread through the Advanced Research Projects
  Agency Network, or ARPANET, the network that became the basis for the
  Internet.


  While most computer viruses created today are malicious in their intent, many coders in the 1980s and 1990s sought to creatively express themselves or disseminate messages through viruses spread on the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) system. Mikko Hypponen, a computer security expert, has put together a large collection of interesting malware that now, devoid of any destructive potential, can be safely viewed and admired for their ingenuity, cheek, and imagination.

      Skynet


      Inspired by the original Terminator movie that hit theatres in 1984, this virus significantly slows down the infected computer. This virus was perhaps a reference to AI, and how it may take over our world. As Jussi Parikka, Professor in Technological Culture & Aesthetics at the University of Southampton writes, “computer viruses almost provide their own version of speculative science fiction. They have even been discussed in research on the possibility of creating artificial life. The virus also slowly proclaimed, “I am a very kind virus,” and went on to tell the user that since they had a lot of work, it would slow their system down, almost as a favour.

      Virdem


      Virdem was written in 1986 by Ralf Burger, who published a book called Computer Viruses: A High-tech Disease. He wrote out the code for the virus in his book, and though it was (apparently) meant to be a demonstration of a virus, many virus writers took inspiration from it, leading to many malicious variants of Virdem. This malware took over the system and created a strobing, multi-coloured effect on the screen, making clear the computer had been infected.

      Redcode


      Redcode is a programming language that was popularly used to run the game ‘Core War.’ The game was popularized by A. K. Dewdney in the 1980s through his articles in the Scientific American. The objective of this game is to overwrite your opponent’s code. Redcode is an esoteric programming language; these languages are created as jokes, as creative expressions, or even to test the limits of programming. This malware shows the two opponents battling it out in Redcode, one ultimately defeating the other. There is a small community of programmers and coders who still play ‘Core War,’ a testament to the difficulty and creativity that engages people even three decades later.

      Walker


      ‘Walker’ originated in Istanbul in 1992, and featured a man strolling through the screen continuously thus taking over the computer. This character, people realized, was from the Commodore 64 game Bad Street Brawler—a wrestling game from the 1980s. Since the creator of this virus is unknown, there have been questions about why this particular character was written in, and what it may mean. A user was unable to do anything with the system as long as the man was walking through the screen. The visual quality of this malware is what makes it interesting to watch.

      Mars Land


      The Mars Land virus was created by Spanska, a French coder, and distributed in January 1997. He created many viruses and his aim was never to make them destructive. For him, the real challenge lay in making creative art through coding; destructive viruses were too easy to write. When run, the Mars virus displays a topographical map of Mars, with the text “coding a virus can be creative.” The group of viruses he created are together known as the Spanska viruses.

      CoffeeShop


      One of the earliest and most popular examples of hacktivism, the coffeeshop malware infected a system while proudly flashing a marijuana leaf with the text ‘LEGALIZE CANNABIS.’ Hitting devices in 1992, the virus deleted files and left only this message on the system. Though the identity of the creator remains a mystery, these viruses show that the intent was not always malicious. Instead of spreading fear or stealing data, malware could spread messages and information.

      Casino


      The Casino virus is popular because of the way it presents itself. It would infect the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) through floppy disks and display the message “I have just destroyed the fat on your disk!!” It then let you gamble for your data: if you won, you could keep your files, but if you lost, they were deleted. While the virus certainly destroyed data and caused havoc, it makes for an interesting and fun simulation when its destructive potential is bracketed. With language many would consider offensive, the casino virus draws in people because of its unique mode of infection. Casino became a real issue in the early 1990s, and the advice was to play the game to have a chance at retrieving your data.

      AIDS


      This was the first documented case of ransomware, a type of software that infected a device until a sum of money was paid to remove it. In 1989, Harvard-trained evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Popp gave these ransomware infected disks to all 20,000 attendees of an international conference on HIV-AIDS. After a computer was rebooted 90 times, the malware would encrypt all the files, and ask for $189 to be paid for decryption. This history gave the virus its name—the AIDS trojan.

      Elvira


      Another virus created by Spanska, this one had no destructive capabilities. Instead, it took over a system and replicated the popular Star Wars scrolling text effect. Elvira became widespread in the late 1990s. While the text on this virus is in Spanish, it was also written in French, and loosely translated to, “black and white girl from Paris, you make me feel alive.” It was supposedly written as an ode to Spanska’s girlfriend. Like the MarsLand virus, Elvira also has a mesmerizing, creative quality to it.

      Zohra


      The Zohra virus was created by a Spanish coder who went by the name ‘Wintermute.’  While the virus spread with stealth, it activated on the 14th of April of the year, and displayed random colours and flashes, ending with the message, “Zohra will live forever! Necromancy with her…”  To evade the anti-virus systems of the time, the Zohra virus did not infect files that included ‘TB,’ ‘AV,’ ‘SC,’ OR ‘IV’ in their path statement. Many anti-virus programs had these initials, and the virus could successfully propagate if it avoided them!

authorbio: "Mikko Hypponen is a computer security expert in Finland. He is the
  Chief Research Officer for F-Secure, a global cyber security company. He has
  worked on many of the worst computer virus outbreaks in history. In 2010, he
  worked on the Stuxnet computer worm which was responsible for damaging parts
  of Iran’s nuclear program. He is also interested in viruses from the 1980s and
  1990s, particularly how they were often created by “happy hackers” and not by
  organised groups with malicious intent. Many of the viruses in the Malware
  Museum archive come from his personal collection, while others were put
  together by Jason Scott, an archivist with the Internet Archive. "
