title: "Mapping Cholera: A Tale of Two Cities"
subtitle: Charting through histories of cholera
medium: Interactive Maps
year: "2014"
description: >-
  The Mapping Cholera project looks at two cholera epidemics almost two
  centuries apart: one in 1832 in New York and the other in 2010 in Haiti. The
  epidemic in Haiti was the worst cholera outbreak in recent history and it left
  the country reeling. The spread of the disease, unlike during the epidemic in
  New York, was diligently documented by Doctors Without Borders and Sonia Shah.
  The challenge was to digitally map the New York epidemic that took place two
  decades before John Snowâ€™s famous mapping of cholera in London (1854). Sonia
  took historical records from doctors of the time and combined them with 19th
  century maps of the city, which had been geocoded by the New York Public
  Library.


  In mapping the two cholera outbreaks, this project allows us to visualise the spread of the disease, the differences and similarities between the two epidemics, and renders visible the magnitude and scale of this disease.
