  The Mapping Cholera project looks at two cholera epidemics almost two
  centuries apart: one in 1832 in New York and the other in 2010 in Haiti. The
  epidemic in Haiti was the worst cholera outbreak in our contemporary, recent
  history, and it left the country reeling. The spread of the disease, unlike
  during the epidemic in New York, was diligently documented by Doctors Without
  Borders and Sonia Shah herself. The challenge was to digitally map the New
  York epidemic that took place two decades before John Snowâ€™s famous mapping of
  cholera in London. Sonia took historical records from doctors of the time and
  combined them with 19th century maps of the city, which had been geocoded by
  the New York Public Library.

  This project maps the two cholera outbreaks, allowing us to visualise the spread of the disease, the differences and similarities between the two epidemics, and renders visible the magnitude and scale of this disease.
