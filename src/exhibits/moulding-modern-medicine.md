  Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) was a Scottish medical bacteriologist at St.
  Mary’s Hospital Medical School in London. He is most popularly known for his
  discovery of penicillin as the world’s first antibiotic, a revolutionary
  discovery that saved many lives, particularly during World War II. To this
  day, penicillin is widely used to fight bacterial infections. 


  While penicillin’s discovery as an antibiotic was accidental, it nonetheless revealed Fleming’s sharp and incisive thinking. Fleming’s short recording presented here—a part of his talk for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) in 1945—is another testament to his wit as he accurately predicts the dangers of antibiotic resistance. He demonstrates not just his knowledge of microbes and biology, but also his keen understanding of human behaviour in medicine. While his discovery turned dangerous infections into easily treatable illnesses, his words too are just as important as we attempt to find ways around antibiotic resistance.

  This short excerpt of Sir Alexander Fleming’s speech proved to be prophetic in its warning about antibiotic resistance, as the world now faces a grave challenge in overcoming bacteria’s growing resistance to present-day antibiotics.

      A photo of the original penicillin mould used by Alexander Fleming. Fleming was studying staph bacteria, and had left his petri dishes of staph cultures unattended for an extended period of time. The culture became infected with mould. When Fleming observed the petri dishes again, he realized that the staph did not grow in and around the mould. Further research led him to conclude that penicillin halted the growth of bacteria!

      A dried down culture of the fungus Penicillium rubens derived from Sir Alexander Fleming’s penicillin producing strain, deposited in the CABI culture collection in the 1940s. This dish contains penicillium spores taken from Alexander Fleming’s research plates. By being fungal spores, this growth from 2017 is a clone of the penicillium that is commonly benchmarked as the first recorded observation of penicillin in 1928.

    authorbio: "The Wellcome Library is a major repository for the study of medical
      history. The Library was founded on the collections of Henry Solomon
      Wellcome (1853-1936), originally a pharmaceutical salesman whose interest
      in the history of medicine led him to collect books and create a Library
      as well as a Museum. Though he envisaged the library to be accessible to
      the public, it was only many years after his death that the collection was
      formally opened to the public as the Wellcome Historical Medical Library.
      Today, the Wellcome Library is focused on making these resources available
      by digitising large parts of its growing collection of manuscripts,
      videos, images, paintings, and much more. "
