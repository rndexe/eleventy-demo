  Scientists at the John Innes Centre (JIC) in Norwich, United Kingdom are
  turning to a range of ants in the search for new antibiotics. Though humans
  have been using antibiotics for nearly a century, we are now facing the
  problem of antimicrobial resistance, where the bacteria that cause diseases in
  our body have become resistant to antibiotics. 


  Ants have been using antibiotics in their fight against pathogens for a much longer time. Scientists believe that investigating the chemical ecology of the ant colonies, and the microbes produced by them can help us tackle the crisis of antimicrobial resistance. This exhibit contains an essay by Adrian Galvin on the work done in this field by Prof. Barrie Wilkinson, Prof. Matt Hutchings and Dr. Victor Soria-Carrasco at JIC. We also have here photographs of the ants and the microbes produced by them, as well as a live-stream of the ants courtesy of the John Innes Centre.
