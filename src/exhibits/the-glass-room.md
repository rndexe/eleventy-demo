  Today we can access information more easily than before, but the veracity of
  this information continues to be called into question with the rise of deep
  fakes, algorithms, and bots. The Misinformation Edition of The Glass Room
  explores how social media and the web have changed the way that we react to
  information.


  Learn why finding “fake news” is not as easy as it sounds, and how the term “fake news” is as much a problem as the news itself. Dive into the world of deep fakes, which are now so realistic that they are virtually impossible to detect. Uncover how social media platforms are designed to keep us hooked and how they can be used to change our minds. These apps were created by Density Design; They are part of the project, "The Glass Room Misinformation Edition", created by Tactical Tech.

      The Glass Room is a public intervention that provides an interactive, fun,
      and challenging experience that brings to life the most pressing
      challenges facing people and the tech industry today. As technology
      reaches a global scale and becomes embedded in every part of our lives and
      our environments, The Glass Room examines its impacts and helps visitors
      explore practical solutions to mitigate them.


      The Glass Room was originally conceived and produced in the context of the exhibition Nervous Systems with support from Haus der Kulturen der Welt in the framework of “100 Years of Now”, and is based on an original concept developed by Stephanie Hankey and Marek Tuszynski shown in March-May 2016 at the HKW in Berlin, Germany.
