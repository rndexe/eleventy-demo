description: >
  Disease maps are a long-standing scientific tool used to understand the spread
  of disease across populations. In this time-lapse film, the artist takes a map
  of Basel, Switzerland made by engraver Matthäus Merian (1593-1650) and turns
  it into a contemporary disease map. Cholera is grown across the map to show
  how the disease might spread across the city; it is also inhibited by novel
  synthetic peptides designed by the artist. This ebb and flow becomes a
  metaphor for our relationship with disease, for the continuous fight against
  emerging diseases and new strains, and the pressing need to address the global
  existential crises that antimicrobial resistance presents.


  The protocols for this work were designed through collaborative and experimental work with Dr Irene Wüthrich and Dr Steven Schmitt from the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) at ETH Zurich. Through observational inquiry and collaborative discussion while working at the D-BSSE, the artist learnt about contemporary synthetic biological approaches to fighting infectious diseases. Whilst critically reflecting on these approaches, she worked closely with scientists to develop new ideas and practical experiments that combined both scientific and artistic practice.

  Sarah Craske works in the liminal, transdisciplinary space between art,
  science, and technology. Her work explores the Anthropocene through
  philosophical enquiry into our relationship with various forms of climate
  breakdown, by drawing on specialist expertise and technologies, and by taking
  part in research collaborations across the world. 


  Her recent works include Biological Hermeneutics, which was speculatively presented through a site-specific installation at Chethams’ Library, Manchester—the oldest public library in the English-speaking world. Her recent awards include the NOVA award (1300 artist applicants) on graduation from Central St Martins (first-class MA Art & Science), an AHRC Science in Culture Innovation Award, and a Biofaction International artist-in-residency in Switzerland.
