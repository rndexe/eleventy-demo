  Wendell Meredith Stanley (1904–1971) was a pioneer in the field of virology.
  With a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Illinois, he worked on many
  pressing scientific concerns of his time. During his time at the Rockefeller
  Institute for Medical Research, Dr. Stanley conducted research on the Tobacco
  Mosaic Virus (TMV), which attacked and destroyed tobacco plants. TMV was the
  first virus ever to be crystallized, and Dr. Stanley’s success at doing so
  forged the symbolic beginnings of molecular biology. Though many viruses were
  known to science at this time, the nature and chemistry of viruses was a
  mystery. His discovery created ripples through the scientific community,
  bolstering research on viral genetics. For his exemplary work, he shared the
  Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946. Dr. Stanley recognized the significance of
  viruses, remarking, “The viruses hold the key to the modification—for better
  or worse—of all life. They hold the key to the secret of life, to the solution
  of the cancer problem to biological evolution, to the understanding and
  control of heredity, perhaps to the nature of all future life on earth” (The
  New York Times, June 16, 1971).

  Travel to the mid-1900s to listen to Wendell Stanley talk about the philosophy and chemistry of viruses, and look at the virus that changed history.

      These images show the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) under two different magnifications. Even under an electron microscope, with the virus magnified 20,000 times, the structure of these microorganisms is indiscernible. Taken in 1948, this photo came 13 years after Wendell Stanley’s crystallization of the virus. To find the molecular components of a virus, without even these highly magnified images, was a true feat in the history of science. Stanley’s discovery that the virus consisted of proteins and RNA (ribonucleic acid) paved the way for the future of virology.

exhibitauthor:
  - authorbio: Hubert Howe Bancroft, was an American historian born in 1832,
      accumulated an immense collection of manuscripts on the history of
      California, and later, also acquired histories of other parts of the US.
      After years of building his collection, he sought a permanent home for
      them, and so The Bancroft Library was born at the University of
      California, Berkeley. It now houses rare books, manuscripts, and other
      unique collections, including the Wendell Stanley papers.

    authorbio: Started in 1951, the Lindau Meetings are a series of annual
      conferences during which various Nobel laureates interact with
      undergraduate and graduate students who will go on to form the next
      generation of scientists.
