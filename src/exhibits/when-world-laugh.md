title: When the World Was A Laugh
subtitle: Decoding the mechanics of a universal experience
medium: Speculative fiction, participative collection, video installation
year: "2021"
description: >-
  Laughter is a uniquely human and collective activity. What people find funny
  might vary by culture, but its contagious nature is obvious. In When the World
  Was A Laugh, the artist invites us to perceive in our own body, the mechanics
  of laughter, its physiological components, its quality as a gesture, and its
  social significance. 


  In an attempt to track down the origins of the most contagious of laughs, Anaïs began documenting the sounds of laughter from across the world through an international Call for Laughs. As she and her collaborator tracked the most contagious ones, they set them into echoes and followed their modes of propagation, creating a speculative fiction. 


  This investigation is presented as an evolutive video of laughs, which keeps growing as we contribute our laughter to this work. This video is complemented by the Collection of Laughs gathered during the investigation and presented as a typology of associated emotions

  and colours. Inspired by the role of laughter in myths around the origin of the universe, this exhibit invites us to share a laugh at a time when the global pandemic has disrupted our ways of connecting and being together.

    authorbio: >-
      Merging natural sciences and anthropology, myth-making, and new media,
      visual artist Anaïs Tondeur’s practice is anchored in ecology thought.
      Creating installations, photographs, or videos, she seeks a new aesthetic,
      in the sense of a renewal of our modes of perception, to find other
      conditions of being in the world. 


      She has been an artist-in-residence in several art centers and scientific laboratories, which include LeCentQuatre-Grand Paris Express (2018-19), Artlink (Ireland, 2019), the Museum of Arts et Métiers (Paris, 2018-17), and the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES, Paris, 2016).


      She has presented and exhibited her work in international institutions such as the Center Pompidou (Paris), La Gaîté Lyrique (Paris), Serpentines Galleries (London), Bozar (Brussels), and Biennale Di Venezia, (Lieux Infinis).

    authorbio: >-
      Floraine Pochon thinks and writes with sound. She creates sound forms,
      hybrid forms, but also forms of transmission in active collaboration with
      French and international artists.

      Since 2013, she breathes for Phaune Radio, a strange wild creature that emits strange

      sounds on the web 24 hours a day. Since 2014, she has been crossing sound and literary

      writings with Alain Damasio for the sound arts studio Tarabust. Since 2016, she has also developed virtual reality audio sites between Montreal and France, with Eric Chahi, for Paper Beast.
