title: THERIAK | The Disease Map
subtitle: Mapping the ebb and flow of diseases
medium: Time-lapse film of Vibrio cholerae interacting with synthetic peptides
  across a map of Basel by engraver Matthäus Merian (1593-1650). 5 min. 3 sec.
year: 2017 – 2019
description: >-
  Disease maps are a long-standing scientific tool used to understand the spread
  of disease across populations. Sarah Craske’s The Disease Map takes an
  engraving of Basel, Switzerland by Matthäus Merian (1593-1650), and turns it
  into a disease map by engraving it onto a custom-made petri dish, within which
  *Vibrio cholerae* was painted (onto agar) over several days while also being
  inhibited with synthetic peptides that Craske designed. This process was
  recorded using time-lapse photography. This ebb and flow becomes a metaphor
  for our relationship with cholera, for the continuous fight against emerging
  diseases and new strains, and the pressing need to address the global
  existential crises that antimicrobial resistance presents.


  The protocols for this work were designed through collaborative and experimental work with Dr Irene Wüthrich and Dr Steven Schmitt from the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) at ETH Zurich. Through observational inquiry and collaborative discussion while working at the D-BSSE, the artist learnt about contemporary synthetic biological approaches to fighting infectious diseases. Whilst critically reflecting on these approaches, she worked closely with scientists to develop new ideas and practical experiments that combined both scientific and artistic practice.

    authorbio: Sarah Craske works in the liminal, transdisciplinary space between
      art, science, and technology. Her work explores the Anthropocene through
      philosophical enquiry into our relationship with various forms of climate
      breakdown, by drawing on specialist expertise and technologies, and by
      taking part in research collaborations across the world. Her recent bodies
      of work include *Returning Shores, Healing Earth, THERIAK* and *Biological
      Hermeneutics*, a site-specific installation at Chethams’ Library,
      Manchester—the oldest public library in the English-speaking world. Recent
      awards include the Whitstable Biennale Jerwood Attachment, currently
      supporting a year of research and development; the John Ruskin Prize
      Shortlist, that identified her as an ‘Agent of Change’; an AHRC Science in
      Culture Innovation Award and a Biofaction artist-in-residence in
      Switzerland.  <http://www.sarahcraske.co.uk/>
  - authorbio: Irene Wüthrich and Steven Schmitt are interested in microbial
      metabolites whose distinct functions have evolved to shape microbial
      interactions and communities, and how we can adapt this diverse molecular
      treasure trove with biological engineering for applications in human
      medicine. In particular, they are developing new solutions to stem the
      tide of rising antibiotic resistance.

    authorbio: Founded in 1925, by Professor J. A. Häfliger, the Pharmacy Museum
      displays one of the world’s largest collections of historic remedies and
      material associated with their production. The museum is the original
      scientific collection, which to this day has remained intact in its
      original form. The extensive collection of early pharmaceuticals
      illustrates different ideas and approaches to disease, as well as
      documents the progression of methodologies from the ancient world until
      the beginning of the pharmaceutical industry in Basel. The "Zum Sessel"
      house, which is now home to the museum, has captured the attention of
      scientists across Europe from as early as the 16th century, when Erasmus
      of Rotterdam and the doctor and alchemist Paracelsus were working there.
      Between 1936 and 1967, Tadeus Reichstein, who received the Nobel Prize in
      Physiology or Medicine in 1950, conducted his research in the very same
      house. <https://pharmaziemuseum.ch/de/>
