description: Lena Bui, provides a crucial perspective on the threat of bird flu
  by following farm workers in a village in north Vietnam, where duck feathers
  are sorted and sent for export to China. Through this film she highlights the
  struggles of farm workers after China placed a ban on importing duck feathers
  following the avian influenza outbreak of 2005. When Birds Dance Their Last
  touches upon various questions surrounding our consumption of animals and
  animal produce, changes in a rural landscape and how disease affects people
  beyond the aspect of health.

  ***Filmmaker***


  Lêna Bùi lives and works in Saigon, Vietnam. Her works are sometimes amusing anecdotes and other times in-depth articulations of the impact of rapid development on people's relationship with nature. She reflects on ways that intangible aspects of life, such as faith, death and dreams influence behaviour and perception. Bùi’s works have been included in group exhibitions and presentations at Sharjah Art Foundation, UAE (2018); Mansfield Freeman Center, Wesleyan University, United States (2018); Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin (2017); The Factory Contemporary Arts Centre, Vietnam (2016); and the Wellcome Collection, London (2013) amongst other venues.
