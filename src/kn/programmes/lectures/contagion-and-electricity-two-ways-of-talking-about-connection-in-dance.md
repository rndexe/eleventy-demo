  Es como electricidad/ el mambo tiene la chispa’ (Mambo is like electricity; it
  contains a spark): thus sang Afro-Cuban diva Celia Cruz in 1951, in ‘Mambo del
  amor’, which celebrated the thrills of this new dance and music genre. From
  the early 19th century onwards, it was commonplace to explain the connection
  produced through social dancing as ‘electricity’. But as the science of
  epidemiology developed through the 19th century, another metaphor also began
  to be used increasingly for that connection: ‘contagion.’ 


  Does social dance spread virally, or does it thrive through an electric connection? How does the competition between these metaphors relate to the formation of modernity’s social dances through colonialism, capitalism, and slavery, and how can we use them to understand the way we must dance during the pandemic?
