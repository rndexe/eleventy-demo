  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has advanced globally since the
  beginning of 2020, exacting an enormous toll on individuals, communities and
  economies. Its scale demands the development of innovative solutions. While
  all past epidemics have been accompanied by infodemics, which the World Health
  Organization defined as a proliferation of information—some accurate, some
  not—that spreads alongside a disease outbreak, the extent of the infodemic
  accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. 


  This talk asks questions about this information pandemic. What causes an infodemic? What are the challenges posed by the infodemic? Can it be eliminated ? Can it be managed? How can we leverage new technologies to manage the infodemic?
