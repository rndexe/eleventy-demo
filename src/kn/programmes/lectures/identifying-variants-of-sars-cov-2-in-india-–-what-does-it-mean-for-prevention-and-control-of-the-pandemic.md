  The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is changing, with about one
  change to its genome (mutation) every two weeks. The resulting virus can be
  considered a variant of the virus that caused the initial outbreak in Wuhan,
  China, in 2019.


  These mutations or chahttps://nowtransmitting.com/admin/#/collections/lecturesnges do not always result in drastic changes to the properties of the virus – such as infectivity, transmission, and immune escape. However, since late 2020, variants that transmit better and/or escape the immune response have been reported from many parts of the world including the UK, Brazil, and South Africa, and have broadly been called Variants of Concern. Local and host-specific factors, such as a large number of infected people, long transmission chains, and persistent infection may have a role in the emergence of VoCs. International travel remains an important means of spread.


  To illustrate these points, Pattabiraman will share her work on SARS-CoV-2 variants that were imported and found circulating in Bengaluru between Nov 2020 – Jan 2021. She will also highlight India’s ongoing, countrywide sequencing effort to rapidly identify VoCs. Genomic information and early identification of variants is crucial since it can inform public health measures, suggest revisions to vaccines, and prepare the health care system for a surge in cases.
