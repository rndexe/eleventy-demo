description: >-
  Between 1817 and 1920, over 70 million people died in the cholera, plague and
  influenza pandemics. Over half of these deaths were in the Indian subcontinent
  alone. Despite the magnitude of lives lost to these devastating diseases, they
  have largely been forgotten in our collective memory. Looking back at these
  pandemics is not only an exercise that helps gain insight into humanity’s
  encounters with infectious diseases, but is also crucial in light of COVID-19
  and the looming possibility of future outbreaks. 


  Based on Professor Chinmay Tumbe’s recent book, this talk points out the significance of past pandemics and how they can be seen in the time of COVID-19.
