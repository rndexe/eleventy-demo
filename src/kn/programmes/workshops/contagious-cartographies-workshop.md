  Humans have been tracking spread and impact of disease for centuries,
  collecting data, and finding insights to understand the disease. History is
  full of terrible consequences of pandemics at particular times and places.
  Since the 19th century, maps have been critical in adding context and have
  helped us understand how diseases spread. In the 19th century, the mode of
  transmission of cholera was not understood and it had killed millions already.
  John Snow had a hunch about the spread of cholera. He had reason to believe
  that it was spread through contaminated water and his mapping of the affected
  households in London’s Soho was instrumental in proving it and fighting
  cholera. 


  With the world battling a pandemic over the last year, there has been an increased interest in collecting and consuming data that can help one make sense of the impact of the disease on our world. This hands-on workshop will dive deeper into how maps in the past have helped us understand diseases, and how you can create an interactive map to explore & narrate stories about deadly diseases.
condition: This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds.
