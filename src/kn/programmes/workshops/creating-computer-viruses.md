description: Computer systems are just as vulnerable in the faces of viruses as
  humans are. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the current global health
  crisis by posing as trusted new sites and tricking you into opening malicious
  attachments. Here’s your chance to learn how to battle digital epidemics! In
  this workshop, you’ll obtain the tools you need to protect yourself, and your
  loved ones from cyber attacks. Additionally, you will also create a computer
  virus from scratch.
