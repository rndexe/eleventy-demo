description: “Mutations” has become a buzzword in the pandemic. Mutations are
  one of the factors behind the changing nature of contagions. Often they are
  interpreted only in terms of their final (harmful) effects. But what exactly
  are mutations, how does one detect them, and how do they cause the contagion
  to change? We can begin by exploring mutations in the context of DNA structure
  (structure manipulation software), how they are detected using
  sequencing/comparisons (available online Bioinformatic tools), and then map
  them on the spike protein 3d structures (available Bioinformatic software).
  Finally, we can explore the effect of some known mutations on the broader
  contagion.
