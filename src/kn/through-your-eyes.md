    caption: Seems like childhood is no longer the same. I can’t imagine a childhood
      with no school, no summer vacations; having to stay indoors and attend
      classes online all the time. This photograph seemed to capture all the
      frustrations and irritation I would feel if I were a young kid during this
      time.
  - coverimage: /static/img/tye_14_syona_mask_a.jpg
    caption: I took this photograph at home using the self timer, a tripod and a
      study lamp as the light source. I used newspapers as a backdrop to
      represent the headlines we're being bombarded with lately. The mask on the
      eyes is to draw attention to how we've physically and mentally withdrawn
      ourselves from each other during the pandemic.

  - coverimage: /static/img/tye_3_aakanksha_bubble_a.jpg
    caption: Like a thin membrane holding a drop of water in a dewdrop, our lives
      are nothing but a bubble. We all have our set of issues, but the beauty
      lies in how we play with the bubble; how we face the turbulence. Through
      every walk of life, we learn a lesson of maturity and discipline. It all
      depends on us, whether we choose to place a bubble of happiness in one’s
      life or be the pin that bursts another being’s bubble!

    caption: This is a photograph from a maternity photoshoot that I did for my
      sister. When I read the prompt ‘Bubble’, this photograph suddenly came to

      through a deadly pandemic.

      indirect effects in the Global South.
    name: Kamesh Bharadwaj
    caption: "Like many of us in 2020 I, too, was fascinated by the concept of home.
      What is it about these boxes we build and shut ourselves in that are so
      dear to us? For this series, I photograph my apartment, other apartments,
      and their extended spaces. Objects, characters, and ideas ooze into these
      shared spaces and take a life of their own. Through these photographs, I
      hope to ask: can we take better care of ourselves, our surroundings and
      even our planet, if we rethink the meaning of home?"

    name: Agroneel Mandal
    caption: The home is like the womb of our mothers, where we find peace and
      safety. As the children look into the darkness, they immerse themselves
      into finding that unknown while the mother awaits her lap to be occupied
      by her children, as her children find the home. This photograph was taken
      in Burdwan, West Bengal. It depicts the ruins of an ancient terracotta
      temple. The children in the photograph are looking at the ruins out of
      curiosity.
  - coverimage: /static/img/tye_2_jolly_home_b.jpg
    caption: 2020 instilled new habits and changed concepts of isolation and self
      reliance. With one parent submerged in healthcare duties, the other parent
      joined them for complete support and both lived away for most of the year.
      This left me to take care of a younger sibling and a house with four cats!
      We’d only meet each other on weekends and rest of the time, it was
      appreciating forgotten habits like waking up to birds, sunrises, and sun
      bathing with the cats.

    name: Shyamli Singbal
    caption: It has been 56 days since my body found itself in the presence of other
      bodies. No bumping into someone; No running into someone, No, not even
      brushing past someone. My hands rummage through a drawer of albums.
      Shhhhhh. . . I am listening to a photograph in an attempt to relive the
      past. Squinting as I bring it closer, I try hard to listen, to feel and in
      some ways relive it. The transmission of sound and energy is very real and
      in my isolated condition this act offers much solace. I may look stupid to
      anyone looking at me right now, but there’s no one around to judge me.
