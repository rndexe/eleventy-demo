  Curious how an online exhibition-season with 16 interactive exhibits and
  public programmes led by more than 45 artists and scholars, was made during
  the pandemic? This session is for you.


  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, museums and galleries across the world closed their doors and began moving online. Science Gallery Bengaluru put out an open call inviting the world to submit their proposals for an online exhibition-season that would explore all things infectious. We received submissions from artists, scholars and young people keen to explore the transmission of diseases, behaviours, emotions and information.


  CONTAGION, our first digital exhibition-season went live globally on 30 April 2021. It explores exciting methods of engagement facilitated by the virtual medium. From our online mediator sessions to our #TakeItFurther resources and live experiments, there are several hidden gems on the [CONTAGION online platform.](https://nowtransmitting.com/)


  Conceptualising, designing and producing a living exhibition like CONTAGION has been an exciting, organic and messy process - most of it invisible to our audience. In this session, we will take you behind the scenes and share with you what that journey has been like.


  Whether you are in the museums or cultural sector, or just interested in how all this happened, join us for an interactive session with the Science Gallery Bengaluru team. We will share our insights and learnings from this exhibition and (if asked nicely) our plans for the next.
