description: As countries around the world impose emergency measures to combat
  the spread of COVID-19, it becomes important to interrogate the impact of
  these measures on vulnerable communities. In this context, human rights offer
  a framework to guide governments and policy-makers, ensure accountability for
  their actions, and highlight the pandemic’s role in exacerbating existing
  inequalities. But who gets to frame these rights? Who gets to advocate for
  them? And who gets to police these rights? This panel discusses how human
  rights, and the production of knowledge are framed within the current global
  health crisis.
