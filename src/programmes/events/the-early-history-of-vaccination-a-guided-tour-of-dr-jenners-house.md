  against smallpox, a disease which has now been eradicated. Now it is open to
  the public and shares the long, global history of vaccination. Join Owen
  Gower, the General Manager at Dr Jenner's House, for a tour of the house and
  its exhibitions which show how this first vaccination changed the world.
