  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that a public health emergency is not a
  medical problem alone—it affects all spheres of society, and requires
  scientific cooperation and communication. Collaboration across disciplines and
  sectors is vital for a comprehensive and inclusive response to the pandemic
  crisis. How can we use cutting-edge research and people-centred public health
  strategies to help mitigate the devastating consequences of COVID-19?


  Join the discussion with a virologist, an infectious disease expert, an epidemiologist, a physician and a professor of community medicine— to explore how cross-disciplinary research combined with sensitive on-the-ground response are crucial to addressing the current public health and socio-economic crises.
