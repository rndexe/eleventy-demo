  Through the eyes of Sierra Leonean filmmaker Arthur Pratt, Survivors presents
  a heart-connected portrait of his country during the Ebola outbreak, exposing
  the complexity of the epidemic and the sociopolitical turmoil that lies in its
  wake. The film chronicles the remarkable stories of two Sierra Leonean
  healthcare workers during what is now widely regarded as the most acute public
  health crisis of the modern era.


  Survivors interweaves the heroic stories of Mohamed Bangura, the senior ambulance driver at the country’s main emergency vehicle dispatch; and Margaret Kabba Sesay, a nurse who works at the Emergency Ebola Treatment Center, caring for some of the sickest patients. As Sierra Leone moves towards containment of the outbreak, we see international organizations draw down their support and begin to understand how the future of the region will be profoundly shaped by the complex decisions made and actions taken by individuals like Margaret, Mohammed, and Arthur. In this way, Survivors explores what it means to be Sierra Leonean at this critical juncture in the country’s history. The film was broadcast on PBS's award winning series POV and was nominated for Peabody and Emmy awards in 2019.
