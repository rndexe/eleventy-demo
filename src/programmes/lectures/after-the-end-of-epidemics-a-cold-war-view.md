description: "The enduring persistence, resurgence and mutation of many epidemic
  diseases have made apparent the problematic nature of the ‘epidemic disease
  narrative’ in the 21st century. With the quick succession of intractable
  global epidemic crises in the early 21st century, clear narratives of
  beginning, crisis, and ‘ending’ have become increasingly untenable as a
  comprehensive explanatory model. Historical research can help us understand
  how epidemic narratives fuelled and mobilised people and resources in the 20th
  century, and approaches we need to consider as we are faced with the uncertain
  trajectory of many diseases in the 21st century. "
