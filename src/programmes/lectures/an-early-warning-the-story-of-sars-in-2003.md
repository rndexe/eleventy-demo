description: The world was taken by surprise when Covid-19 erupted in early
  2000. But we should have expected something like this. From HIV/AIDS to Ebola,
  nature has given us many warnings in recent times of the damage that
  previously unknown viral diseases can cause. SARS which erupted in southern
  China in late 2002, and then spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore
  and Canada was a precursor of the Covid-19. The way it arose, the kind of
  disease it resulted in, was a forewarning of what we are experiencing today.
  This lecture looks at what happened during SARS and the lessons the world
  learned, and failed to learn from it.
