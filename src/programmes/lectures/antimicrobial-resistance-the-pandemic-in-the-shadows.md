  Ever since their discovery, antibiotics have dramatically changed the
  management and treatment of infections in humans and animals. Paradoxically,
  their use and selective pressure leads to genetic changes in bacteria critical
  for their survival, and gives rise to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).


  COVID 19 has demonstrated the power of infectious diseases to reset our lives, and unless AMR is tackled urgently, the antibiotics we take for granted today will be unavailable to the future generations to come. This talk will show how AMR has reached pandemic proportions, and cover a range of topics, questions, and concerns regarding the same.
