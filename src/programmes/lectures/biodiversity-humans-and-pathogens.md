description: Biodiversity is all around us, and so are pathogens. In fact 70% of
  the infectious diseases that affect humans spillover from animals. What do we
  understand about why spillover happens? In this lecture, Uma Ramakrishnan
  explores some examples of spillover. She will then discuss some studies to
  investigate spillover in India in two biodiversity hotspots, the Western ghats
  and northeastern India. She will talk about the role of biodiversity, and
  specific groups of animals like bats and rats, and the role that global change
  may play in this process. Finally, she will discuss how a One Health approach
  is crucial to reducing the outbreak of zoonotic diseases.
