  COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that crossed from
  animals to humans. It has cast a sharp spotlight on the enormous challenges
  posed by “zoonoses”—those infections that move between animals and humans. A
  zoonotic event of this kind has been anticipated for many decades, and our
  current understandings and approaches are rooted in developments in framing
  zoonoses as both ecological and global problems over the last seventy years. 


  This talk puts into historical perspective some of the changing ways in which zoonoses have been framed and tackled as global problems connected to human interactions with animals, with changing environments, and with each other through globalised systems of animal food production and consumption. It highlights efforts to build scientific collaboration and surveillance systems across species to monitor and manage these infections, but also the daunting biological, economic, cultural and geopolitical challenges that they present. The takeaway historical message is that effective approaches to controlling zoonoses need to be grounded in understanding their complex global ecologies, which are increasingly shaped by the growing scale and impact of human relations with animals and their environments.

expertbio: Professor Michael Bresalier is a lecturer in the history of modern
  medicine and global health at Swansea University. His research examines how
  international health organisations have shaped knowledge and experiences of
  health and disease in the twentieth century. He is especially interested in
  the role of United Nations agencies (WHO, FAO, UNICEF, etc) in tackling
  problems of hunger, nutrition, and infectious disease in humans and animals,
  and with how these problems have been crucial to projects of development,
  human rights, and humanitarianism.
