  The effects of viral infections on animals and plants have been known for
  centuries. While such effects are generally negative, causing many diseases
  (for example, polio and smallpox), there are instances in plants where virus
  infections are prized and have resulted in an economic boom, such as
  “Tulipomania” in The Netherlands in the 17th century. However, despite
  awareness of the consequences of virus infection, it was not until the late
  19th century that the causative agents were identified as a distinctive class
  of pathogen, a “contagion vivum fluidum” or “virus”. However, as they cannot
  be cultured in vitro or observed by light microscopy, the precise nature of
  viruses remained enigmatic until well into the 20th century. Once it was
  realised that virus particles were simple structures that could be studied
  structurally, biochemically and genetically, they played a central role in the
  development of modern molecular biology. 


  This talk will discuss the study of plant viruses from their initial characterisation as disease-causing organisms, through their role in our understanding of virus structures and genetics, to their current deployment for combatting animal diseases through the creation of novel vaccines, diagnostic reagents and anti-cancer therapies. We’ve come a long way since viruses were first recognised approximately 120 years ago!

expertname: George Lomonssoff
expertbio: George Lomonossoff obtained both his B.A. and Ph.D. from the
  University of Cambridge and joined the John Innes Centre, Norwich in 1980. His
  research has focused on the molecular biology of RNA plant viruses and their
  use in bio- and nanotechnology. In 2012 he was named “BBSRC Innovator of the
  year” for his work on plant-made pharmaceuticals and in 2015 delivered the
  Microbiology Society Colworth Prize Lecture. The transient expression system
  he developed (CPMV-HT) is used worldwide and is currently deployed by Leaf
  Expression Systems, Norwich to scale-up production of plant-made products.
