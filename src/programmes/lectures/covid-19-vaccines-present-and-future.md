  and public health communication. It is clear that we need accurate and
  accessible scientific information, especially with regards to vaccines.\

In doing so, Dr Kang will also answer critical questions on the mechanisms of vaccination and its limits, for us to better grasp our role in the current global drive for vaccination.
