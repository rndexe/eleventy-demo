description: >-
  COVID-19 has transformed the ways in which social, cultural, political, and
  economic factors influence the way a people and the state respond to health
  crises. The politics of healthcare are complex and differ from country to
  country, population to population. The histories and anthropologies of
  epidemics have become increasingly urgent to study, so that we may better
  prepare ourselves for the future. 


  Drawing on ethnographic and historical research on HIV/AIDS care and support and the 2014-16 epidemic of Ebola in Sierra Leone, Benton will address some of the key ideologies, social practices, and political-economic factors underpinning epidemic response, as well as the means by which state and non-state actors configure care during an epidemic.
