  The entire world faces a shortage of coronavirus vaccines, even though it is
  to different degrees. Rich countries aren’t getting enough, and many poor
  countries aren’t getting any vaccines at all. As we clamour for concessions
  for western pharmaceutical companies—to license their monopolies on
  intellectual property and know-how—we may have a solution hiding in plain
  sight: vaccines from China and Russia, as well as from India, and a host of
  other countries including Thailand, Vietnam and Cuba. Vaccines from these
  countries are available in large quantities, and in some cases, with their
  technology free to be used by anyone interested. The problem? Overcoming the
  credibility gap they face, a gap that organisations like the WHO are not
  equipped to fix, and to the contrary, are designed to exacerbate. 


  This talk asks whether, and how, we can move the centre of pharmaceutical innovation beyond a handful of western countries in order to achieve better outcomes for the entire world, including the west itself.
