  The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is changing, with about one
  change to its genome (mutation) every two weeks.


  These mutations or changes do not always result in drastic changes to the properties of the virus – such as infectivity, transmission, and immune escape. However, since late 2020, variants that transmit better and/or escape the immune response have been reported from many parts of the world including the UK, Brazil, and South Africa, and have broadly been called Variants of Concern. 


  To illustrate these points, Pattabiraman will share her work on SARS-CoV-2 variants that were imported and found circulating in Bengaluru between Nov 2020 – Jan 2021.
