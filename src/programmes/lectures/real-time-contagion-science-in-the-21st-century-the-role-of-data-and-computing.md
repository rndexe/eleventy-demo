description: >-
  Infectious diseases cause more than 10 million deaths a year worldwide.
  Despite significant advances by scientists and public health authorities that
  have led to reduced rates of infections and mortality, we continue to find
  ourselves unable to respond rapidly and effectively to pandemics.


  In this lecture, Dr. Marathe and his team will argue that pandemics are a complex systems problem that go beyond human health and national boundaries. They will discuss how and if recent advances in computing, data and biological sciences can be harnessed to develop new techniques and engineering principles that can further advance the field and, in the end, help reduce the global burden of infectious diseases.
