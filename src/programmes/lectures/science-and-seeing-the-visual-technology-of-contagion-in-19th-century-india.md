  The technology that we use today allows us to explore the microscopic world in
  great detail. Before we had cutting-edge gadgets to study medicine and
  biology, scientists used various other technologies, tools, and methods to
  advance their knowledge. So, how did scientists in the 19th century see
  disease? What instruments were available to them and how did they interpret
  and use visual evidence? 


  Using the examples of microscopy and photography, this talk by Professor David Arnold explores the microcosm and macrocosm of contagion, the changing role of instruments and imagery in medical science, and the rise of the laboratory in India from the first cholera epidemics to bubonic plague in the 1890s.
