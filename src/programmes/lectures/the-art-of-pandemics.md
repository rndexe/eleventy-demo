  The current pandemic has given rise to a number of artistic enquiries.
  Documenting the high and lows of these uncertain times through photographs,
  zines, digital art and podcasts, are just some of the ways in which the
  pandemic has spurred the creation of art. In times of crisis, art becomes a
  vital way through which we might understand and examine humanityâ€™s collective
  experiences of tragedy and triumph. 


  This lecture considers artistic responses to past pandemics caused by diseases such as the bubonic plague, smallpox, influenza, and HIV/AIDS. Also in consideration is the lack of epidemic-related archives in India, and the related absence of these calamities in our collective memory.
