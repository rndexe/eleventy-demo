  New social movements, technologies and public-health initiatives often
  struggle to succeed, yet

  many diseases disperse rapidly. Can viral diffusion be a model to improve spread of beneficial

  behaviors and innovations? Professor Damon Centola will discuss breakthroughs in the science of network diffusion, and how these have improved understanding of how changes in societal behavior—in voting, health, technology, finance, vaccination, and disease prevention - occur, and how social networks can influence how they propagate. Many accepted ideas about viral spreading have in fact been responsible for causing past diffusion efforts to fail. Centola presents new findings to enable social change efforts to succeed much more effectively.

expertbio: Damon Centola is a Professor in the Annenberg School for
  Communication, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the School
  of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, where he is Director
  of the Network Dynamics Group and a Senior Fellow at the Leonard Davis
  Institute of Health Economics.   His research centers on social networks and
  behavior change.  His work has been published across several disciplines in
  journals such as Science, Nature Communications, PNAS, American Journal of
  Sociology, Circulation and Journal of Statistical Physics. Damon received the
  American Sociological Association’s Award for Outstanding Research in
  Mathematical Sociology in 2006, 2009, and 2011; the Goodman Prize for
  Outstanding Contribution to Sociological Methodology in 2011; the James
  Coleman Award for Outstanding Research in Rationality and Society in 2017; and
  the Harrison White Award for Outstanding Scholarly Book in 2019.  He was a
  developer of the NetLogo agent based modeling environment, and was awarded a
  U.S. Patent for inventing a method to promote diffusion in online
  networks.  He is a member of the Sci Foo community and Fellow of the Center
  for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.
