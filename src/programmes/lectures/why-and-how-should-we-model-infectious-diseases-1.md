description: >-
  Pandemics of infectious disease conjure up images of crowded hospitals,
  medical staff in protective gear and bodies, loads of them. They certainly
  donâ€™t suggest images of people working at computers or at boards, writing down
  equations and looking at graphs and figures. Yet, understanding what might be
  the probable trajectory of a disease and how best to reduce its impact is a
  problem that lies squarely in the realm of mathematical modelling. 


  Why are these models necessary? What insights can we gain from them? In this talk, Professor Gautam Menon will discuss these questions, as well as survey some epidemic models that are used to understand and model disease spread.
