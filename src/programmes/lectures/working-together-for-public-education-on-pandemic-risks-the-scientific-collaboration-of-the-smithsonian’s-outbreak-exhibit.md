  Since 2018, the Smithsonian’s exhibit ‘Outbreak: Epidemics in a Connected
  World’ has demonstrated the power of museums in public education about
  pandemic risks. For the National Museum of Natural History, the exhibit has
  been a remarkable success made possible by the extraordinary support of
  scientific partners and collaborators in the global health community.


  In this lecture, Sabrina Sholts, the curator of the ‘Outbreak’ exhibit, will discuss how she and her team worked with countless experts—from infectious disease physicians like Daniel Lucey (Georgetown University) to wildlife veterinarians like Jonathan Epstein (EcoHealth Alliance) to government scientists like Anthony Fauci (National Institutes of Health)—to help people understand how novel viruses emerge and spread in our interconnected world. She will share insights into a process of science communication that began before the COVID-19 pandemic started and continues as this new disease, and those yet to come, remain threats to us all.
