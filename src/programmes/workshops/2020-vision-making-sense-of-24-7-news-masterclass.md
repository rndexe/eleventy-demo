  On 18 April 1930, the announcer at the BBC in London declared "There is no
  news", and the 15 minute news programme was replaced by piano music. Today, we
  risk becoming overwhelmed by the 24/7 torrent of online news and information.
  How can we possibly process it all? How can we decide what is real and what is
  fake? How can we switch off?


  This masterclass discusses some of these problems, and how artists have responded to information in the age of the internet. The session will include a presentation on the move from analogue to digital information , a look at how some artists have chosen to respond to information overload and a conversation with Science Gallery Research Intern Vasudha Malani to investigate UK and Indian online search algorithms. How do search results differ by country, by region, and by language?


  The session will conclude with an open discussion, where you can share your perspectives on the world of information overload and how we can make sense of it all.
condition: "This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "

  Robert Good is an artist based in Cambridge UK. He is editor of A New
  Dictionary of Art and founder and director of the artist collective Art
  Language Location. His podcast Something To Do With Art features discussions
  with experimental artists about what they do and why.


  Good uses the framework and conventions of contemporary art to offer fresh perspectives. He says: "My work is frequently propositional in nature. I like to analyse a situation, try to understand it and then make work that re-presents it, reflecting back both the limitations of my understanding and my responses to it. As such, my work functions in some ways like a scientific hypothesis - it is offered for others to consider, validate or falsify."
