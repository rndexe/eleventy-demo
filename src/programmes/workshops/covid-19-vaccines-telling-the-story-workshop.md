  Many more people are engaging with vaccines than ever before, and those
  without science and health expertise are required to know about and make
  decisions in this incredibly complex area. In this workshop, we’ll explore the
  role of communication and advocacy (with the example of Wellcome’s Covid-19
  vaccines information hub) in this complex space. 


  In this workshop, Hannah Chhoa-Howard will take you through the process of creating and running a campaign on vaccines, and you will have the opportunity to develop ideas on how you could run communications or advocacy campaigns on Covid-19 in your communities. 
condition: "This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "
