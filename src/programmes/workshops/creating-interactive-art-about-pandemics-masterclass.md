  In 2018 Blast Theory were the first artists-in-residence at the World Health
  Organization in Geneva. A Cluster of 17 Cases is inspired by the stories of
  the 17 unsuspecting people who stayed on the 9th floor of the Metropole Hotel
  in Hong Kong on the night of Feb 21, 2003. These 17 people were subsequently
  identified as spreading the SARS virus to at least 546 people around the
  globe.


  As part of their residency, they made three trips to interview key staff at the Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC), which monitors epidemics and pandemics across the world and coordinates international collaboration in response. They explored how epidemiologists studied the movements of each of the guests in the Metropole Hotel that night; even conducting tests to trace airflow between rooms.


  In this Masterclass, the director of Blast Theory, Matt Adams will take you behind-the-scenes to explore the process of making an interactive exhibit inspired by the events that occurred in Metropole Hotel on that fateful night. 
condition: "This masterclass is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "
