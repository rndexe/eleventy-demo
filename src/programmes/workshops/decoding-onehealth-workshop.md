  OneHealth is a strategy to simultaneously address the health of humans,
  animals, and the environment. This pandemic highlights the disconnect among
  human, environmental, animal, and wildlife health on the one hand, and
  implementers, decision-makers, and academia on the other hand. This
  interactive workshop will use expert interactions and gamification to engage
  participants in the world of OneHealth.  


  You will learn to recognize the interconnectedness amongst human, animal and environmental health, identify the need for and use of current OneHealth strategies at local, national and global levels, and understand how OneHealth strategies can be used in your homes and communities to improve human and environmental wellbeing. We are all OneHealth, and OneHealth is for all of us. Join us to learn how you, and everything around you is a vital part of our planet’s future.
