description: Derived from a course developed for students at the Indian
  Institute of Science, this masterclass by Vijay Chandru explores how
  engineered systems such as Google Flu Trends, Flowminder, and Healthmap, among
  others can be employed to study disease trends and models in populations. The
  participants would become familiar with the concepts and methods of
  epidemiology in the context of todayâ€™s digital era.
