  'Drawing the Bombay Plague' was an image that served as a reminder of the
  unfortunate arrival and the imagination of the early days of a pandemic. The
  drawing hinted at the generic mistakes, the callous attitudes of government
  officials, the panic of populations encountering an unfamiliar of diseases ,
  information about diseases that was not disseminated, and the glaring mistakes
  that we as society continue to repeat. At the time of making the drawing in
  2017, it culminated from research that had stemmed from a few years earlier,
  and with a so called “working knowledge of pandemics," historically speaking.
  So Ranjit Kandalgaonkar, the artist, always knew that we would be a new
  pandemic, but it was a matter of when.


  The workshop 'Drawing (from) the Bombay Plague' will be an opportunity to interrogate, discuss and enliven the comparison between a historical pandemic and the unique situation we find ourselves in of a pandemic that is currently unfolding.

  Ranjit Kandalgaonkar lives and works in Mumbai, and his art practice primarily
  comprises a lens directed at the urban context of cities. Projects such as
  cityinflux, Gentricity, build/browse and Stories of Philanthropic Trusts map
  vulnerability within redevelopment strategies of urbanisation, record
  anomalous histories, or document timelines and “blindspots”—alternate markers
  of a city that’s unraveling.  A study of the combative histories of
  reclamation and speculation has led to projects such as Isles amidst
  reclamation and Seven Isles Unclaimed, which map ever-diminishing
  geographies. 


  Ranjit’s awards and grants include the Majlis Visual Arts Fellowship, the U.D.R.I Architectural Fellowship, the Leverhulme Artist Residency, the SAI Harvard University Artist Residency, and the Seed Funding Award-Wellcome Trust.
