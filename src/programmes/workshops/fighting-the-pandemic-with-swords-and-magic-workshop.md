  The world is trapped in the jaws of a deadly pandemic. The virus knows no
  mercy: once infected, everyone suffers. Unfortunately, we do not have any
  powerful spell to go back in time and erase the virus from our real world. We
  have to fight our way through it. 


  In a parallel virtual world, another virus has besieged an entire content. However one city remains fortified. But this safety might be short lived if you don’t take matters into your own hands. You must defend yourself, and combat the spread. The weapons in your arsenal are the strategies used to fight pandemics; contact tracing, testing, and quarantining. Explore concepts in epidemiology by battling this virtual pandemic. Choose your weapons carefully. The fate of the city lies in your hands! 
condition: "This workshop is exclusively for 15 to 28 year olds. "
