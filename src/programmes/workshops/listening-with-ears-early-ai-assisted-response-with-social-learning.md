  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital communications and
  social networking have supported the rapid growth of real-time information
  sharing about the virus and the disease in the public domain. The breadth of
  the conversation, the diversity of sources and polarity of opinions have
  resulted in a sometimes indiscriminate amplification of verified and
  unverified information alike. This infodemic (too much information including
  false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during an
  acute public health event, which leads to confusion, risk-taking and behaviors
  that can harm health, and lead to mistrust in health authorities and public
  health response) can elongate or amplify outbreaks, and can reduce
  effectiveness of pandemic response efforts and interventions.


  In response to the infodemic risk, WHO has launched the EARS platform (Early AI-assisted Response with Social Listening), which shows real-time information about how people are talking about COVID-19 online. This information is intended to serve health information professionals to understand narratives and needs of the general public, in order to inform policy or communications decisions. In this Masterclass, you will learn about the data and analytics technologies behind EARS.
