description: "It is essential for life, both medically and metaphorically, yet
  we are repulsed by it. Blood tells many stories, about life and death and a
  world in between, yet there are stories that remain untold: what happens with
  the blood of animals in the age of industrialized slaughter? And what kind of
  stigma has to be faced when carrying an infectious disease in your blood? This
  masterclass will ask those questions and explore the narratives that unfold
  once microscopic images of blood are visualised."

expertname: Basse Stittgen
expertbio: The work of Basse Stittgen is positioned at the intersection of
  design, art and material research. It stems from a fascination for matter, how
  it can be created, applied, used, reused and questioned. This approach might
  lead to investigations into production cycles, or become a tool to unfold
  hidden narratives and potentials embedded in matter.
