description: "What can Google Search Trends tell us about the spread of
  COVID-19? According to epidemiologists, and open data researchers, it can help
  us predict hotspots, allocate resources, and prevent outbreaks. In this
  workshop, learn how Google Search Trends can be mined as a source of open
  data. You too can help track, trace and predict outbreaks -- all you need are
  the right tools. "
