  Disease maps are a long-standing scientific tool used to understand the spread
  of disease across populations. Craske’s The Disease Map takes an engraving of
  Basel by Matthäus Merian (1593-1650), and turns it into a disease map by
  engraving it onto a custom-made petri dish, within which cholera was painted
  (onto agar) over several days while also being inhibited with synthetic
  peptides that Craske designed. The process was recorded using time-lapse
  photography. The protocols were designed through collaborative and
  experimental work with Dr. Irene Wüthrich and Dr. Steven Schmitt, from the
  D-BSSE, ETH Zurich.


  During the workshop, Craske will explain in detail the final protocol that was used to successfully ensure that her synthetic peptide 'THERIAK' inhibited the growth of the vibrio cholerae. You will then learn how to make the garlic extract, which was used within the agar plate to weaken vibrio cholerae's cell walls.

expertname: "Sarah Craske "
expertbio: Sarah Craske works in the liminal, transdisciplinary space between
  art, science and technology. Her work explores the Anthropocene, through
  philosophical enquiry into our relationship with various forms of climate
  breakdown, drawing on specialist expertise and technologies, and taking part
  in research collaborations across the world.Craske exhibits in
  interdisciplinary places of histories, knowledge, narratives and context,
  including libraries, museums, and laboratories. Purposefully prioritising
  their rich contexts over white cube galleries, these sites, buildings and
  organisations provide materials to work with, and become an structural part of
  the work.
