description: “Mutations” has become a buzzword in the pandemic. Mutations are
  one of the factors behind the changing nature of contagions. Often they are
  interpreted only in terms of their final (harmful) effects. But what exactly
  are mutations, how does one detect them, and how do they cause the contagion
  to change? We can begin by exploring mutations in the context of DNA structure
  (structure manipulation software), how they are detected using
  sequencing/comparisons (available online Bioinformatic tools), and then map
  them on the spike protein 3d structures (available Bioinformatic software).
  Finally, we can explore the effect of some known mutations on the broader
  contagion.
condition: This workshop is only for 15-28 year olds.

expertbio: >-
  Meenakshi is a postdoctoral fellow in the Indo-Africa consortium for dengue
  sequencing, vaccine development and capacity building with Prof. Sudhir
  Krishna at NCBS, TIFR in Bangalore. She works on pathogen genomics and
  metagenomics studies and genome-wide sequence and structural analysis of viral
  family proteins. She is broadly interested in application of computational
  biology to translational health science like pathogen surveillance, evolution
  and vaccine design. 


  Saurabh is an Assistant Professor of Basic Sciences at Atria University in Bangalore. He is an evolutionary biologist with a fascination and curiosity for the biological past, which he tries to study using the computational analysis of DNA and protein sequences. He is also passionate about teaching undergrads using interactive pedagogical tools, and likes to involve undergraduates in research.
