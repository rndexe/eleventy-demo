    caption: I took this photograph at home using the self timer, a tripod and a
      study lamp as the light source. I used newspapers as a backdrop to
      represent the headlines we're being bombarded with lately. The mask on the
      eyes is to draw attention to how we've physically and mentally withdrawn
      ourselves from each other during the pandemic.

    caption: Like a thin membrane holding a drop of water in a dewdrop, our lives
      are nothing but a bubble. We all have our set of issues, but the beauty
      lies in how we play with the bubble; how we face the turbulence. Through
      every walk of life, we learn a lesson of maturity and discipline. It all
      depends on us, whether we choose to place a bubble of happiness in one’s
      life or be the pin that bursts another being’s bubble!

    caption: 2020 instilled new habits and changed concepts of isolation and self
      reliance. With one parent submerged in healthcare duties, the other parent
      joined them for complete support and both lived away for most of the year.
      This left me to take care of a younger sibling and a house with four cats!
      We’d only meet each other on weekends and rest of the time, it was
      appreciating forgotten habits like waking up to birds, sunrises, and sun
      bathing with the cats.
    name: "Jolly Saikia "
